# Portfolio Construction and Risk Management Project 

## Project Description
This project constructs a portfolio based on stock selection criteria and applies risk management techniques, with a highlight on the Historical Value at Risk (VaR) and Sharpe Ratio, to evaluate performance.
The aim is to immitate real world applications. 

To challenge myself to with a rebalancing strategy to replicate changing conditions 

Stock selected based on the following criteria (Beta yield, Dividened yield, Maximum sector Weight)
Historical gathering of the data from the last X years 
Calulate the market Capitalisation 

Future improvement to include

## Libaries
To run this project, you will need to install the following Python libraries:
- `yfinance` for downloading historical stock data
- `pandas` for data manipulation
- `numpy` for numerical calculations
- `matplotlib` for data visualization
- `statsmodels` for time series analysis (if using the VAR model)



 ## Performance Metrics

1. **Sharpe Ratio**: Measures the portfolioâ€™s risk-adjusted return.
2. **Volatility**: Annualized standard deviation of returns, indicating risk.
3. **Maximum Drawdown**: The largest peak-to-trough decline in the portfolio's value during the period.
4. **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Estimates the potential loss for the portfolio over a given time period and confidence level.
5. **Cumulative Returns**: Shows how the portfolio's total value grows over time.


## What we are hoping to see after the rebalancing
